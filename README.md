# MSP430FR2355 Booster Pack PCB Template
This is a template for the course project in ECE 09.342, given as a PCB and Schematic. This is also meant to be a respository which you can use to update your PCB incrementally throughout the semester.

## Instructions for initially opening the PCB and Schematic
1. Clone the Repo onto your Computer
Using GitKraken or GitBash, clone the repo onto your computer. Make sure you pick a location you can remember easily.
2. Open PCB File in Diptrace
Open Diptrace, then the PCB Editor. You then need to open the PCB file from the repository location on your computer.
3. Update PCB from Schematic
Go to File --> Renew Layout From Schematic --> By Components. Pick the Schematic File in the repoitory.
4. Save both files.
